# Machine Learning Kaggle Competitions

Here, you will find several of the Machine Learning Kaggle Competitions that I have completed using various Machine Learning methods. The machine learning topics that are included within these files include training shallow models, training shallow neural networks, tree based models, linear and logistic regression, and training deep neural networks. Some of the models that I used include Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Random-Forest Classifier, Multilayer-Perceptron Classifier, Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting, Convolution Neural Networks, and State-Of-The-Art pre-trained models. Feel free to explore the models I created for these Kaggle Competitions, as they include files regarding my model such as data preprocessing, tuning of hyperparameters, model selection, and example submission files.
